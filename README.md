# Community NuPIC Algorithm Research

This repository is the community version of Numenta's [nupic.research](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.research) repository, but completely controlled and maintained by the NuPIC community. 

## Purpose

This respository exists so anyone who wishes to experiment with new NuPIC algorithms or changes to existing NuPIC algorithms may do so in a flexible, restriction-free space. This allows prototypes of community algorithm changes to be tested, benchmarked, shared amongst interested parties, and demonstrated to NuPIC committers with the eventual goal of porting these changes into NuPIC itself. 

## Disclaimer

This is by nature an experimental repository. You should not depend on any code here.

- the contents can change without warning or explanation
- the code will change quickly as experiments are discarded and recreated
- it might not change at all for a while
- it could just be plain wrong or buggy for periods of time
- code will not be production-quality and might be embarrassing
